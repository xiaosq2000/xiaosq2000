## 🐾 My Repos

🌱 Archived toys or course projects when doing my bachelor's degree in Automation at HITSZ:
- [An Underwater SLAM Simulator](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/underwater-slam-simulator) (bachelor's thesis)
- [A 6-axis manipulator playing Jenga](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/robotics-final-project) (course project of *Introduction to Robotics*)
- [A vision-based self-parking little vehicle](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/DIP-final-project) (course project of *Digital Image Processing*)
- [An smart air fan](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/intg_fan) (course project of *Electronics Engineering Training*)
- [A simple python script to do daily reports during the COVID-19 epidemic](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/HITSZ-Self-Monitor) (self-motivated)

🤓 Geeky configurations or dockerized developing environments, always WIP:
- my dotfiles (to do)
- ROS++ in docker (to upload)
- [LaTex in docker](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/latex-docker)
- [sing-box in docker](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/sing-box-docker)

📚 Notes or slides to share [(repo)](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/notes):
- Measure, Probability and Stochastic Process [(PDF)](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/notes/blob/main/measure_probability_and_stochastic_process/main.pdf)
- Basics and Variants of Kalman filter [(PDF)](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/notes/blob/main/kalman_filter/main.pdf)

Besides, some closed-source projects I've contributed to are listed in my CV.

<!-- ## 💬 My Interests -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 🔭 Improve the trilemma of robustness, precision and cost of robotic SLAM solutions. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Exploit heterogeneous computing resource (GPU, NPU, DSP, etc. ) on affordable SoCs to do SLAM. -->
<!-- - Intergrate SOTA tools, like Unreal Engine 5, ROS 2 and sophisticated sensor models as a powerful simulation platform to boost SLAM R&D. -->
<!-- - Life-long SLAM based on semantic-topological mapping. -->
<!-- - Indoor localization based on Wi-Fi, bluetooth, Li-Fi, etc.. -->
