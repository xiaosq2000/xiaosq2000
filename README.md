## 💬 My Interests

🔭 Improve the trilemma of robustness, precision and cost of robotic SLAM solutions.

💡 Some wild ideas:

- Exploit heterogeneous computing resource (such as GPU, NPU, DSP, even FPGA ...) on affordable SoCs to do SLAM.
- Intergrate Unreal Engine 5, ROS 2 and sophisticated sensor models as a powerful simulator to boost SLAM R&D.
- Life-long SLAM based on semantic-topological mapping.

## 🐾 My Repos

🤓 Geeky configurations or dockerized developing environments, always WIP:
- my dotfiles (to do)
- ROS++ in docker (to upload)
- [LaTex in docker](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/latex-docker)
- [sing-box in docker](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/sing-box-docker)

📚 Notes or slides to share (products of the Feynman Technique):
- [From Kalman Filter to FEJ-MSCKF](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/notes/blob/main/kalman_filter/main.pdf) (WIP)
- [Quaternion without Tears] (WIP)

🌱 Archived toys or course projects when doing my bachelor's degree in Automation at HITSZ:
- [An Underwater SLAM Simulator](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/underwater-slam-simulator) (bachelor's thesis)
- [A 6-axis manipulator playing Jenga](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/robotics-final-project) (course project of *Introduction to Robotics*)
- [A vision-based self-parking little vehicle](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/DIP-final-project) (course project of *Digital Image Processing*)
- [An smart air fan](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/intg_fan) (course project of *Electronics Engineering Training*)
- [A simple python script to do daily reports during the COVID-19 epidemic](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/HITSZ-Self-Monitor) (self-motivated)

Besides, some closed-source projects I've contributed to are listed in my CV.
